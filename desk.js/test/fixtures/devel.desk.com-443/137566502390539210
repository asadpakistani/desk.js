You can display the articles on your Support Center and use them in Agent interactions with your customers  \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n Enabling Multilingual Support \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n Step 1: In the Desk.com Admin,  go to Settings-&gt;Multilingual Support-&gt;Advanced Settings. Set a default language for your Desk.com Support Center and enable additional languages you'd like to support.  \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n Step 2: If you’re using the Default Support Center template, your customers will immediately view drop-down to select their language. If you’ve already customized your template, add a new Support Center template and then apply your formatting changes.  Your customers will then have the option to view content in a different language.  \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n Step 3: Once a customer selects a language in the upper right hand corner of the Support Center he or she will get the language-specific version of you Support Center, with search results only from content and topics localized to that language. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n Adding Translations of Support Content \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n Before your agents will be able to support your customers in various languages, you’ll need to add the translated content to your Knowledge Base. Once that’s done, your customers will be able to view the content in the various languages and you can create macros for your agents in each supported language. Here’s how:  \r\n\r\n Adding Translated Content to your Knowledge Base \r\n\r\n Once the content is in the system, you can use it in Business Rules, Filters, and Macros to enable your agents to provide support in all the languages that you have enabled.

In addition, if you want a header or a footer link to appear on every page, place it in the <a href=\"#layout\">Layout</a> section.</li>\r\n\t<li>You can use a dynamic variable set at the top of your page if you&#39;d like to rewrite a variable later in the page, e.g. {%assign myVariable =&quot;Hello&quot;%} to set it and then {{myVariable}} to output it later in the page.</li>\r\n\t<li>Your changes are live - so you may want to make a copy of your template and preview it to see the results of your changes before you publish them.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"#top\">back to top</a></h5>\r\n<a name=\"header\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h4>Customizing the Header Section of your Customer Help Center</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Header Section of the Advanced Mode Help Center Editor provides you with a central place to manage your Style declarations and scripts. You can also use this area to dynamically change the title of the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few general tips you&#39;ll want to consider for the header section:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If you&#39;re using CSS to override a style element that&#39;s set somewhere else in Desk.com, you can use the &quot;!important&quot; suffix to make sure that your change is applied (if you need a good CSS primer, check out the <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/\">W3C Schools CSS site</a>&nbsp;or the handy Snippets at <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/snippets/\">CSS Tricks</a>.)</li>\r\n\t<li>You can import external style sheets or scripts in this section</li>\r\n\t<li>You can set page header values in this section</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: Adding a border to the .content Class on the #support-main div using the &quot;!important&quot; suffix</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You may want to style an existing element of Desk.com without making a large change. An example of a change that overrides an existing class is to add a border to the Content class on the support-main div, e.g.:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:20px !important;margin-right:20px !important;\">#support-main .content { border: 6px solid #CCC !important; //the !important suffix ensures that our CSS change will be applied }</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: Changing the Page Name depending on which Desk.com page is displaying</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use the Liquid templating language to change the page dynamically in Desk.com.

In addition, if you want a header or a footer link to appear on every page, place it in the Layout section. \r\n You can use a dynamic variable set at the top of your page if you'd like to rewrite a variable later in the page, e.g. {%assign myVariable =\"Hello\"%} to set it and then {{myVariable}} to output it later in the page. \r\n Your changes are live - so you may want to make a copy of your template and preview it to see the results of your changes before you publish them.\n \r\n  back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Header Section of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n The Header Section of the Advanced Mode Help Center Editor provides you with a central place to manage your Style declarations and scripts. You can also use this area to dynamically change the title of the page.\n\nHere are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the header section: \r\n\r\n  If you're using CSS to override a style element that's set somewhere else in Desk.com, you can use the \"!important\" suffix to make sure that your change is applied (if you need a good CSS primer, check out the W3C Schools CSS site or the handy Snippets at CSS Tricks.) \r\n You can import external style sheets or scripts in this section \r\n You can set page header values in this section \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: Adding a border to the .content Class on the #support-main div using the \"!important\" suffix \r\n\r\n You may want to style an existing element of Desk.com without making a large change. An example of a change that overrides an existing class is to add a border to the Content class on the support-main div, e.g.: \r\n\r\n #support-main .content { border: 6px solid #CCC !important; //the !important suffix ensures that our CSS change will be applied } \r\n\r\n Example: Changing the Page Name depending on which Desk.com page is displaying \r\n\r\n You can use the Liquid templating language to change the page dynamically in Desk.com. One way you might choose to change the page is to write a different message in the HTML title of the page.\n\nThis example demonstrates how you can add a value to the page title by customizing the html title tag in the Header section of the Desk.com Advanced Mode Customer Help Center editor.\n\nThe possible values of the page variable are as follows: \r\n\r\n  page_index \r\n page_search_result \r\n page_search_topic \r\n page_search_article \r\n question_new \r\n question_pre_create \r\n question_show \r\n email_new \r\n email_pre_create \r\n email_submitted \r\n chat_new \r\n chat_pre_create \r\n  Use the value of the page variable to create a page-specific layout or write out a specific message, e.g.: \r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;title&gt;\r\n  {{ site.company_name }} | \r\n  {% if page == 'page_index' %}\r\n    Portal\r\n  {% elsif page == 'page_search_result' %}\r\n    Search Results\r\n  {% elsif page == 'page_topic' %}\r\n    {{ topic.name | clip:40 }}\r\n  {% endif %}\r\n&lt;/title&gt; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Layout Section of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n Use the Layout Section of the Advanced Mode editor to set the general layout of your Desk.com Help Center that appears on every Customer Help Center page. You will most likely use this area to set up the general structure of your page design or manipulate changes that appear on every page.\n\nHere are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the layout section: \r\n\r\n  You can use the layout section to include areas such as a header or footer that you want to repeat on every page - this makes the customization process much faster \r\n The default layout section contains the Search and Tweet widgets; if you'd like to customize them, you can do so here. \r\n  Example: providing a link to a specific topic in the sidebar \r\n\r\n If you have topic information that your customers don't always use, you can create a specific list topics that appears in the sidebar of your Customer Help Center to share valuable content your customers might have missed; in this case - the contents of a specific topic.\n\nUse a for loop function in Liquid and some html layout to create this \"teaser\" in the \"support-side\" div of the layout section to write out the name and link of the first article in the \"Hello World\" topic, e.g. \r\n\r\n \r\n{%for topic in topics%} \r\n      {% if topic.name == \"Hello World\"%}\r\n\r\n      &lt;h3&gt;{{topic.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n{% for article in topic.articles limit:1 %}\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"{{ article.public_url }}\"&gt;{{ article.subject_plain | clip:40 }}&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n       {% endif %} \r\n{%endfor%} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Index Page of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n The index page is the \"home\" page of your Customer Help Center and is the first page displayed.\n\nHere are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the Index page: \r\n\r\n  The index page provides your general navigation - you can customize it to provide a dynamically generated list of topics rather than the default table design \r\n You can change the layout for the index page while maintaining the overall look and feel of the overall layout \r\n The index page contains liquid collections of topics; each topic contains a collection of articles \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: change the default table to topics to a dynamically written out list \r\n\r\n A common customization to the index page of the Desk.com Customer Help Center is to write out a dynamic list of topics.

In addition, if you want a header or a footer link to appear on every page, place it in the <a href=\"#layout\">Layout</a> section.</li>\r\n\t<li>You can use a dynamic variable set at the top of your page if you&#39;d like to rewrite a variable later in the page, e.g. {%assign myVariable =&quot;Hello&quot;%} to set it and then {{myVariable}} to output it later in the page.</li>\r\n\t<li>Your changes are live - so you may want to make a copy of your template and preview it to see the results of your changes before you publish them.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"#top\">back to top</a></h5>\r\n<a name=\"header\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h4>Customizing the Header Section of your Customer Help Center</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Header Section of the Advanced Mode Help Center Editor provides you with a central place to manage your Style declarations and scripts. You can also use this area to dynamically change the title of the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few general tips you&#39;ll want to consider for the header section:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If you&#39;re using CSS to override a style element that&#39;s set somewhere else in Desk.com, you can use the &quot;!important&quot; suffix to make sure that your change is applied (if you need a good CSS primer, check out the <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/\">W3C Schools CSS site</a>&nbsp;or the handy Snippets at <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/snippets/\">CSS Tricks</a>.)</li>\r\n\t<li>You can import external style sheets or scripts in this section</li>\r\n\t<li>You can set page header values in this section</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: Adding a border to the .content Class on the #support-main div using the &quot;!important&quot; suffix</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You may want to style an existing element of Desk.com without making a large change. An example of a change that overrides an existing class is to add a border to the Content class on the support-main div, e.g.:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:20px !important;margin-right:20px !important;\">#support-main .content { border: 6px solid #CCC !important; //the !important suffix ensures that our CSS change will be applied }</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: Changing the Page Name depending on which Desk.com page is displaying</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use the Liquid templating language to change the page dynamically in Desk.com. One way you might choose to change the page is to write a different message in the HTML title of the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This example demonstrates how you can add a value to the page title by customizing the html title tag in the Header section of the Desk.com Advanced Mode Customer Help Center editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The possible values of the <b>page</b> variable are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>page_index</li>\r\n\t<li>page_search_result</li>\r\n\t<li>page_search_topic</li>\r\n\t<li>page_search_article</li>\r\n\t<li>question_new</li>\r\n\t<li>question_pre_create</li>\r\n\t<li>question_show</li>\r\n\t<li>email_new</li>\r\n\t<li>email_pre_create</li>\r\n\t<li>email_submitted</li>\r\n\t<li>chat_new</li>\r\n\t<li>chat_pre_create</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the value of the page variable to create a page-specific layout or write out a specific message, e.g.:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;title&gt;\r\n  {{ site.company_name }} | \r\n  {% if page == &#39;page_index&#39; %}\r\n    Portal\r\n  {% elsif page == &#39;page_search_result&#39; %}\r\n    Search Results\r\n  {% elsif page == &#39;page_topic&#39; %}\r\n    {{ topic.name | clip:40 }}\r\n  {% endif %}\r\n&lt;/title&gt; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"#top\">back to top</a></h5>\r\n<a name=\"layout\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h4>Customizing the Layout Section of your Customer Help Center</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the Layout Section of the Advanced Mode editor to set the general layout of your Desk.com Help Center that appears on every Customer Help Center page. You will most likely use this area to set up the general structure of your page design or manipulate changes that appear on every page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few general tips you&#39;ll want to consider for the layout section:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You can use the layout section to include areas such as a header or footer that you want to repeat on every page - this makes the customization process much faster</li>\r\n\t<li>The default layout section contains the Search and Tweet widgets; if you&#39;d like to customize them, you can do so here.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: providing a link to a specific topic in the sidebar</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have topic information that your customers don&#39;t always use, you can create a specific list topics that appears in the sidebar of your Customer Help Center to share valuable content your customers might have missed; in this case - the contents of a specific topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use a for loop function in Liquid and some html layout to create this &quot;teaser&quot; in the &quot;support-side&quot; div of the layout section to write out the name and link of the first article in the &quot;Hello World&quot; topic, e.g.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n{%for topic in topics%} \r\n      {% if topic.name == &quot;Hello World&quot;%}\r\n\t\r\n      &lt;h3&gt;\t{{topic.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t{% for article in topic.articles limit:1 %}\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=&quot;{{ article.public_url }}&quot;&gt;{{ article.subject_plain | clip:40 }}&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t{% endfor %}\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n       {% endif %} \r\n{%endfor%} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"#top\">back to top</a></h5>\r\n<a name=\"index\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h4>Customizing the Index Page of your Customer Help Center</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The index page is the &quot;home&quot; page of your Customer Help Center and is the first page displayed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere are a few general tips you&#39;ll want to consider for the Index page:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The index page provides your general navigation - you can customize it to provide a dynamically generated list of topics rather than the default table design</li>\r\n\t<li>You can change the layout for the index page while maintaining the overall look and feel of the overall layout</li>\r\n\t<li>The index page contains liquid collections of <strong>topics</strong>; each topic contains a collection of <strong>articles</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: change the default table to topics to a dynamically written out list</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>A common customization to the index page of the Desk.com Customer Help Center is to write out a dynamic list of topics. The default HTML writes out this content as a table; however, you may want to write it out and style it differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n{%for topic in topics%}\r\n\t&lt;h3&gt;\r\n\t\t{{topic.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\t&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t\t{% for article in topic.articles %}\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;a href=&quot;{{ article.public_url }}&quot;&gt;{{ article.subject_plain | clip:40 }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t\t{% endfor %}\r\n\t&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t{%endfor%}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"#top\">back to top</a></h5>\r\n<a name=\"page\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h4>Customizing the Article, Topic, and Search Results Pages of your Customer Help Center</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Article, Topic, and Search Results pages are other frequently-visited pages in your Customer Help Center:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Article page of the Customer Help Center provides the template for any page where an Article is displayed.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Topic page of the Customer Help Center is the template for a list of all the articles in that Topic.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Search Results page provides a list of all the items returned from a dynamic Desk.com search.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few general tips you&#39;ll want to consider for the article, topic, and search results pages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Using a simple if statement or a case statement, you can provide specialized layout for each Topic page (e.g. the &quot;Welcome&quot; Topic may have a different background graphic than the &quot;Advanced&quot; Topic page</li>\r\n\t<li>If you don&#39;t like the default search result you can change the styling so that items have longer or shorter preview length</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: removing the pagination link on a topic page</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Desk.com gives you the ability to page between available topics on a topic page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;d like to remove this link and display only some of the topics (in this example, we&#39;re limiting the display to 5, simply make the following changes in the Advanced Mode editor on the Page(Topic) page:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>change {% for article in articles %} to {% for article in topic.articles limit:5 %}</li>\r\n\t<li>remove &lt;div id=&#39;pagination&#39;&gt; {{ more_article_block }} &lt;/div&gt;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: displaying only the first 100 characters of a link</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can apply a liquid <a href=\"https://github.com/shopify/liquid/wiki/liquid-for-designers\">filter</a> to {{ article.body_text | truncate:100 }}<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"#top\">back to top</a></h5>\r\n<a name=\"qanda\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h4>Customizing the Community Q&amp;A Pages of your Customer Help Center</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Community Question and Answer Pages (Q&amp;A) are displayed when you enable Questions and Answers in a specific topic on your Customer Help Center. Here are a few general tips you&#39;ll want to consider for the Q&amp;A pages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You may want to use some CSS styling to highlight a best answer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"#top\">back to top</a></h5>\r\n<a name=\"email\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h4>Customizing the Email Pages of your Customer Help Center</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Desk.com uses two different kinds of email intake forms in the Customer Help Center - the main one you&#39;re likely to use is the Email form - and you may also choose to use the email widget. Here are a few general tips you&#39;ll want to consider for the Email pages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If you&#39;d like to use different email forms, you can customize additional copies of the Email form pages using additional Help Center templates</li>\r\n\t<li>You can use the Email widget to style input from a mobile phone or tablet; you can also use the Email widget to place your Desk.com email form on another site than your Support Help Center.</li>\r\n\t<li>You should consider using the email &quot;Pre-Create&quot; to offer additional options to customers and increase the likelihood that they will help themselves instead of creating a ticket.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: Changing the Fields on the Email Form to take First and Last Name</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You may wish to ask for both first and last names when your customers email you - in that case, simply remove the {{interaction_name}} field from your email form and add in the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfirst: &lt;input class=&quot;default l&quot; id=&quot;customer_first_name&quot; name=&quot;customer[first_name]&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;\r\nlast: &lt;input class=&quot;default l&quot; id=&quot;customer_last_name&quot; name=&quot;customer[last_name]&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt; \r\n</pre>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"#top\">back to top</a></h5>\r\n<a name=\"chat\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h4>Customizing the Chat Pages of your Customer Help Center</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enable Chat in Desk.com, there are two sets of pages that you can customize - the individual chat pages and a &quot;Widget&quot; that you can embed elsewhere. Here are a few general tips you&#39;ll want to consider for the Chat pages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You can style both the initial chat page and the page that results when you&#39;ve connected to the Desk.com Chat</li>\r\n\t<li>If you&#39;d like to display the Chat link only when Agents are available, you&#39;ll need to use the Chat Widget</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5>Example: Making a field required on the Chat Form</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>To make a field required, you&#39;ll need to add to the existing jquery statement that&#39;s running in the page. For example, if you wanted the phone number to be required, you could add:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$(&quot;#interaction_phone&quot;).rules(&quot;add&quot;, { required:true, messages: { required: &quot;! required&quot; }\r\n</pre>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"#top\">back to top</a></h5>\r\n<a name=\"vars\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Available Variables in the Customer Support Center</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A note on usage: </strong>if you&#39;re using a variable would like to output its value, use the curly brackets to tell the Liquid interpreter to output this variable, e.g. {{home_link}}). If you are using a variable name inside an expression or within another Liquid tag, you don&#39;t need the curly brackets.

You can also use this area to dynamically change the title of the page.\n\nHere are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the header section: \r\n\r\n  If you're using CSS to override a style element that's set somewhere else in Desk.com, you can use the \"!important\" suffix to make sure that your change is applied (if you need a good CSS primer, check out the W3C Schools CSS site or the handy Snippets at CSS Tricks.) \r\n You can import external style sheets or scripts in this section \r\n You can set page header values in this section \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: Adding a border to the .content Class on the #support-main div using the \"!important\" suffix \r\n\r\n You may want to style an existing element of Desk.com without making a large change. An example of a change that overrides an existing class is to add a border to the Content class on the support-main div, e.g.: \r\n\r\n #support-main .content { border: 6px solid #CCC !important; //the !important suffix ensures that our CSS change will be applied } \r\n\r\n Example: Changing the Page Name depending on which Desk.com page is displaying \r\n\r\n You can use the Liquid templating language to change the page dynamically in Desk.com. One way you might choose to change the page is to write a different message in the HTML title of the page.\n\nThis example demonstrates how you can add a value to the page title by customizing the html title tag in the Header section of the Desk.com Advanced Mode Customer Help Center editor.\n\nThe possible values of the page variable are as follows: \r\n\r\n  page_index \r\n page_search_result \r\n page_search_topic \r\n page_search_article \r\n question_new \r\n question_pre_create \r\n question_show \r\n email_new \r\n email_pre_create \r\n email_submitted \r\n chat_new \r\n chat_pre_create \r\n  Use the value of the page variable to create a page-specific layout or write out a specific message, e.g.: \r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;title&gt;\r\n  {{ site.company_name }} | \r\n  {% if page == 'page_index' %}\r\n    Portal\r\n  {% elsif page == 'page_search_result' %}\r\n    Search Results\r\n  {% elsif page == 'page_topic' %}\r\n    {{ topic.name | clip:40 }}\r\n  {% endif %}\r\n&lt;/title&gt; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Layout Section of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n Use the Layout Section of the Advanced Mode editor to set the general layout of your Desk.com Help Center that appears on every Customer Help Center page. You will most likely use this area to set up the general structure of your page design or manipulate changes that appear on every page.\n\nHere are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the layout section: \r\n\r\n  You can use the layout section to include areas such as a header or footer that you want to repeat on every page - this makes the customization process much faster \r\n The default layout section contains the Search and Tweet widgets; if you'd like to customize them, you can do so here. \r\n  Example: providing a link to a specific topic in the sidebar \r\n\r\n If you have topic information that your customers don't always use, you can create a specific list topics that appears in the sidebar of your Customer Help Center to share valuable content your customers might have missed; in this case - the contents of a specific topic.\n\nUse a for loop function in Liquid and some html layout to create this \"teaser\" in the \"support-side\" div of the layout section to write out the name and link of the first article in the \"Hello World\" topic, e.g. \r\n\r\n \r\n{%for topic in topics%} \r\n      {% if topic.name == \"Hello World\"%}\r\n\r\n      &lt;h3&gt;{{topic.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n{% for article in topic.articles limit:1 %}\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"{{ article.public_url }}\"&gt;{{ article.subject_plain | clip:40 }}&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n       {% endif %} \r\n{%endfor%} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Index Page of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n The index page is the \"home\" page of your Customer Help Center and is the first page displayed.\n\nHere are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the Index page: \r\n\r\n  The index page provides your general navigation - you can customize it to provide a dynamically generated list of topics rather than the default table design \r\n You can change the layout for the index page while maintaining the overall look and feel of the overall layout \r\n The index page contains liquid collections of topics; each topic contains a collection of articles \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: change the default table to topics to a dynamically written out list \r\n\r\n A common customization to the index page of the Desk.com Customer Help Center is to write out a dynamic list of topics. The default HTML writes out this content as a table; however, you may want to write it out and style it differently.\n\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n{%for topic in topics%}\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n{{topic.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n{% for article in topic.articles %}\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"{{ article.public_url }}\"&gt;{{ article.subject_plain | clip:40 }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n{%endfor%}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Article, Topic, and Search Results Pages of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n The Article, Topic, and Search Results pages are other frequently-visited pages in your Customer Help Center: \r\n\r\n  The Article page of the Customer Help Center provides the template for any page where an Article is displayed. \r\n The Topic page of the Customer Help Center is the template for a list of all the articles in that Topic. \r\n The Search Results page provides a list of all the items returned from a dynamic Desk.com search.  \r\n  Here are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the article, topic, and search results pages: \r\n\r\n  Using a simple if statement or a case statement, you can provide specialized layout for each Topic page (e.g. the \"Welcome\" Topic may have a different background graphic than the \"Advanced\" Topic page \r\n If you don't like the default search result you can change the styling so that items have longer or shorter preview length \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: removing the pagination link on a topic page \r\n\r\n Desk.com gives you the ability to page between available topics on a topic page.\n\nIf you'd like to remove this link and display only some of the topics (in this example, we're limiting the display to 5, simply make the following changes in the Advanced Mode editor on the Page(Topic) page: \r\n\r\n  change {% for article in articles %} to {% for article in topic.articles limit:5 %} \r\n remove &lt;div id='pagination'&gt; {{ more_article_block }} &lt;/div&gt; \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: displaying only the first 100 characters of a link \r\n\r\n You can apply a liquid filter to {{ article.body_text | truncate:100 }}\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Community Q&amp;A Pages of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n The Community Question and Answer Pages (Q&amp;A) are displayed when you enable Questions and Answers in a specific topic on your Customer Help Center. Here are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the Q&amp;A pages: \r\n\r\n  You may want to use some CSS styling to highlight a best answer.\n\n \r\n  back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Email Pages of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n Desk.com uses two different kinds of email intake forms in the Customer Help Center - the main one you're likely to use is the Email form - and you may also choose to use the email widget. Here are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the Email pages: \r\n\r\n  If you'd like to use different email forms, you can customize additional copies of the Email form pages using additional Help Center templates \r\n You can use the Email widget to style input from a mobile phone or tablet; you can also use the Email widget to place your Desk.com email form on another site than your Support Help Center. \r\n You should consider using the email \"Pre-Create\" to offer additional options to customers and increase the likelihood that they will help themselves instead of creating a ticket. \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: Changing the Fields on the Email Form to take First and Last Name \r\n\r\n You may wish to ask for both first and last names when your customers email you - in that case, simply remove the {{interaction_name}} field from your email form and add in the following: \r\n\r\n \r\nfirst: &lt;input class=\"default l\" id=\"customer_first_name\" name=\"customer[first_name]\" type=\"text\" /&gt;\r\nlast: &lt;input class=\"default l\" id=\"customer_last_name\" name=\"customer[last_name]\" type=\"text\" /&gt; \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Chat Pages of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n If you enable Chat in Desk.com, there are two sets of pages that you can customize - the individual chat pages and a \"Widget\" that you can embed elsewhere. Here are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the Chat pages: \r\n\r\n  You can style both the initial chat page and the page that results when you've connected to the Desk.com Chat \r\n If you'd like to display the Chat link only when Agents are available, you'll need to use the Chat Widget \r\n  Example: Making a field required on the Chat Form \r\n\r\n To make a field required, you'll need to add to the existing jquery statement that's running in the page. For example, if you wanted the phone number to be required, you could add: \r\n\r\n \r\n$(\"#interaction_phone\").rules(\"add\", { required:true, messages: { required: \"! required\" }\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Available Variables in the Customer Support Center \r\n\r\n A note on usage: if you're using a variable would like to output its value, use the curly brackets to tell the Liquid interpreter to output this variable, e.g. {{home_link}}). If you are using a variable name inside an expression or within another Liquid tag, you don't need the curly brackets.

In addition, if you want a header or a footer link to appear on every page, place it in the Layout section. \r\n You can use a dynamic variable set at the top of your page if you'd like to rewrite a variable later in the page, e.g. {%assign myVariable =\"Hello\"%} to set it and then {{myVariable}} to output it later in the page. \r\n Your changes are live - so you may want to make a copy of your template and preview it to see the results of your changes before you publish them.\n \r\n  back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Header Section of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n The Header Section of the Advanced Mode Help Center Editor provides you with a central place to manage your Style declarations and scripts.

An example of a change that overrides an existing class is to add a border to the Content class on the support-main div, e.g.: \r\n\r\n #support-main .content { border: 6px solid #CCC !important; //the !important suffix ensures that our CSS change will be applied } \r\n\r\n Example: Changing the Page Name depending on which Desk.com page is displaying \r\n\r\n You can use the Liquid templating language to change the page dynamically in Desk.com.

You will most likely use this area to set up the general structure of your page design or manipulate changes that appear on every page.\n\nHere are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the layout section: \r\n\r\n  You can use the layout section to include areas such as a header or footer that you want to repeat on every page - this makes the customization process much faster \r\n The default layout section contains the Search and Tweet widgets; if you'd like to customize them, you can do so here. \r\n  Example: providing a link to a specific topic in the sidebar \r\n\r\n If you have topic information that your customers don't always use, you can create a specific list topics that appears in the sidebar of your Customer Help Center to share valuable content your customers might have missed; in this case - the contents of a specific topic.\n\nUse a for loop function in Liquid and some html layout to create this \"teaser\" in the \"support-side\" div of the layout section to write out the name and link of the first article in the \"Hello World\" topic, e.g. \r\n\r\n \r\n{%for topic in topics%} \r\n      {% if topic.name == \"Hello World\"%}\r\n\r\n      &lt;h3&gt;{{topic.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n{% for article in topic.articles limit:1 %}\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"{{ article.public_url }}\"&gt;{{ article.subject_plain | clip:40 }}&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n       {% endif %} \r\n{%endfor%} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Index Page of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n The index page is the \"home\" page of your Customer Help Center and is the first page displayed.\n\nHere are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the Index page: \r\n\r\n  The index page provides your general navigation - you can customize it to provide a dynamically generated list of topics rather than the default table design \r\n You can change the layout for the index page while maintaining the overall look and feel of the overall layout \r\n The index page contains liquid collections of topics; each topic contains a collection of articles \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: change the default table to topics to a dynamically written out list \r\n\r\n A common customization to the index page of the Desk.com Customer Help Center is to write out a dynamic list of topics. The default HTML writes out this content as a table; however, you may want to write it out and style it differently.\n\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n{%for topic in topics%}\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n{{topic.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n{% for article in topic.articles %}\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"{{ article.public_url }}\"&gt;{{ article.subject_plain | clip:40 }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n{%endfor%}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Article, Topic, and Search Results Pages of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n The Article, Topic, and Search Results pages are other frequently-visited pages in your Customer Help Center: \r\n\r\n  The Article page of the Customer Help Center provides the template for any page where an Article is displayed. \r\n The Topic page of the Customer Help Center is the template for a list of all the articles in that Topic. \r\n The Search Results page provides a list of all the items returned from a dynamic Desk.com search.  \r\n  Here are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the article, topic, and search results pages: \r\n\r\n  Using a simple if statement or a case statement, you can provide specialized layout for each Topic page (e.g. the \"Welcome\" Topic may have a different background graphic than the \"Advanced\" Topic page \r\n If you don't like the default search result you can change the styling so that items have longer or shorter preview length \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: removing the pagination link on a topic page \r\n\r\n Desk.com gives you the ability to page between available topics on a topic page.\n\nIf you'd like to remove this link and display only some of the topics (in this example, we're limiting the display to 5, simply make the following changes in the Advanced Mode editor on the Page(Topic) page: \r\n\r\n  change {% for article in articles %} to {% for article in topic.articles limit:5 %} \r\n remove &lt;div id='pagination'&gt; {{ more_article_block }} &lt;/div&gt; \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: displaying only the first 100 characters of a link \r\n\r\n You can apply a liquid filter to {{ article.body_text | truncate:100 }}\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Community Q&amp;A Pages of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n The Community Question and Answer Pages (Q&amp;A) are displayed when you enable Questions and Answers in a specific topic on your Customer Help Center. Here are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the Q&amp;A pages: \r\n\r\n  You may want to use some CSS styling to highlight a best answer.\n\n \r\n  back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Email Pages of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n Desk.com uses two different kinds of email intake forms in the Customer Help Center - the main one you're likely to use is the Email form - and you may also choose to use the email widget. Here are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the Email pages: \r\n\r\n  If you'd like to use different email forms, you can customize additional copies of the Email form pages using additional Help Center templates \r\n You can use the Email widget to style input from a mobile phone or tablet; you can also use the Email widget to place your Desk.com email form on another site than your Support Help Center. \r\n You should consider using the email \"Pre-Create\" to offer additional options to customers and increase the likelihood that they will help themselves instead of creating a ticket. \r\n    \r\n\r\n Example: Changing the Fields on the Email Form to take First and Last Name \r\n\r\n You may wish to ask for both first and last names when your customers email you - in that case, simply remove the {{interaction_name}} field from your email form and add in the following: \r\n\r\n \r\nfirst: &lt;input class=\"default l\" id=\"customer_first_name\" name=\"customer[first_name]\" type=\"text\" /&gt;\r\nlast: &lt;input class=\"default l\" id=\"customer_last_name\" name=\"customer[last_name]\" type=\"text\" /&gt; \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Customizing the Chat Pages of your Customer Help Center \r\n\r\n If you enable Chat in Desk.com, there are two sets of pages that you can customize - the individual chat pages and a \"Widget\" that you can embed elsewhere. Here are a few general tips you'll want to consider for the Chat pages: \r\n\r\n  You can style both the initial chat page and the page that results when you've connected to the Desk.com Chat \r\n If you'd like to display the Chat link only when Agents are available, you'll need to use the Chat Widget \r\n  Example: Making a field required on the Chat Form \r\n\r\n To make a field required, you'll need to add to the existing jquery statement that's running in the page. For example, if you wanted the phone number to be required, you could add: \r\n\r\n \r\n$(\"#interaction_phone\").rules(\"add\", { required:true, messages: { required: \"! required\" }\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n back to top \r\n\r\n\r\n Available Variables in the Customer Support Center \r\n\r\n A note on usage: if you're using a variable would like to output its value, use the curly brackets to tell the Liquid interpreter to output this variable, e.g. {{home_link}}). If you are using a variable name inside an expression or within another Liquid tag, you don't need the curly brackets. You can find the list of variables used in the Desk.com Support Center here: List of Liquid Variables in Desk.com.  \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \nRelated Articles \r\n\r\n  List of Liquid Variables in Desk.com \r\n Liquid for Designers (external link) \r\n Making the Customer Help Center Your Own \r\n Advanced Help Center Template Editing","body_facebook_auto":true,"keywords":"liquid, customer portal, customize, advanced mode, css","position":12,"quickcode":null,"in_support_center":true,"internal_notes":"","publish_at":"2013-05-10T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2011-11-15T01:41:36Z","updated_at":"2013-05-13T17:57:05Z","_links":{"self":{"href":"/api/v2/articles/240552","class":"article"},"topic":{"href":"/api/v2/topics/512525","class":"topic"},"translations":{"href":"/api/v2/articles/240552/translations","class":"article_translation"}}},{"subject":"Tuning Support Center Search Results","body":"<p>\r\n\tThe Help Center search searches the content of the &quot;Subject&quot; and &quot;Body&quot;&nbsp;of the public Knowledge Base articles.&nbsp;The results are sorted by relevance that is determined by the occurrence of each of the search terms in the articles. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Help Center search also searches&nbsp;&quot;Questions and Answers&quot;. &nbsp;The results are sorted by relevance that is determined by the occurrence of each of the search terms in the question and/or answer. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo modify the search weighting, click the &quot;Channels&quot; tab.

If you leave this blank, no phone number will be shown. \n \n Step 4: Pull in your Twitter feed. Under the Integrations Tab, you can pull in your Twitter feed to populate on the bottom right of  the webpage to make sure your customers get the latest updates on your company when they’re using your Support Center. \n \n Step 5: You can update the header to match your website, add common navigation at the bottom with a footer, and further style your support center by editing the Custom CSS on the Customize Content tab. \n \n If you want to perform more advanced customizations, you can do so on the Advanced Template editor tab. The Advanced Mode feature allows you complete control of the underlying HTML, CSS and Liquid for your portal. \n If you need help making your Support Center look and feel like you? Ask your account manager or contact us to learn about the Desk.com Professional Services Design Packages.","body_facebook_auto":true,"keywords":"","position":4,"quickcode":null,"in_support_center":true,"internal_notes":"","publish_at":"2013-05-10T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2013-04-24T01:58:05Z","updated_at":"2013-05-13T13:49:18Z","_links":{"self":{"href":"/api/v2/articles/1110362","class":"article"},"topic":{"href":"/api/v2/topics/499013","class":"topic"},"translations":{"href":"/api/v2/articles/1110362/translations","class":"article_translation"}}},{"subject":"Glossary","body":"<u><strong>Admin -&nbsp; </strong></u>The Admin is the area of the user interface you can utilize to set up your users, and manage your account.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Agent -&nbsp;</strong></u> The Agent is the User Interface area you can manage your customer support cases<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Reports&nbsp;</strong></u> The Reports is the area of the User Interface where you can manage your data in a Dashboard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Rules</strong></u> - The conditions that can be changed to allow your customer support cases to be handled based on certain criteria<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Macros</strong></u> - A shortcut for creating responses or any text you would like to be displayed to the user based on certain criteria.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Cases</strong></u> -&nbsp; A case is a customer support problem that can be assigned, resolved, deleted.
